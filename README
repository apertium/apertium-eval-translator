apertium-eval-translator
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Simple Perl script to evaluate Apertium-based machine translation
systems.

This software calculates (at document level) the word error rate (WER)
and the position-independent word error rate (PER) between a
translation performed by the Apertium MT system and a reference
translation obtained by post-editing the system output.

For more information execute the script (after installation)
without arguments

$ apertium-eval-translator

apertium-eval-translator-line
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Similar to apertium-eval-translator but it assumes that test and reference
files has the same number of sentences and are in the one-sentence-per-line format

bootstrap_resampling
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Computes confidence intervals for MT evaluation. See paper
http://acl.ldc.upenn.edu/acl2004/emnlp/pdf/Koehn.pdf

Scripts wer, ter and bleu ares provided as examples of
the script that needs to be supplied to
bootstrap_resampling to evaluate MT performance.
Note: ter and bleu need software not distributed in this package.

apertium-eval
-------------------------------------------------------------------
This is not intended to be a substitute for Felipe Sanchez's
apertium-eval-translator. It just provides an alternative way
to approximate the word error rate by processing the output of "diff -d".
Run apertium-eval without arguments for a usage message.
